## Transform Off-Chain Points into Tradeable Assets

Checkpoint is a decentralized protocol that bridges off-chain loyalty points and rewards programs with on-chain liquidity. Enable seamless tokenization, trading, and settlement of points before Token Generation Events (TGE).

## What is Checkpoint?

Checkpoint provides two main services that work together to create a complete points ecosystem:

## How Checkpoint Works

Checkpoint creates a complete ecosystem for points trading with five core components:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register Your Program">
    Configure your points program in the Registry contract with custom parameters
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tokenize Points">
    Users deposit off-chain points and receive ERC20 tokens + soulbound NFTs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trade Pre-TGE">
    Enable market trading with collateral-based offers before token launch
  </Step>
  <Step title="Settle Cross-Chain">
    Distribute tokens across multiple chains using LayerZero infrastructure
  </Step>
</Steps>
