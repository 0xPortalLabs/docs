# Checkpoint Aggregator

The **Points Aggregator** is your central hub for viewing all your points across different projects. Instead of checking multiple websites and platforms, see everything in one unified dashboard.

The aggregator allows you to check points balances without connecting a wallet. You can simply paste any address and retrrieve the points directly in your browser. The system fetches points data from integrated protocols and displays the results for available points to that address.

## Aggregator Features

The Points Aggregator fires the [adapters](https://github.com/0xPortalLabs/points-adapters) which power the [Points API](/core-products/point-api) endpoints to retrieve and normalize the data for the dashboard. It creates a data snapshot and displays points for protocols you have points for, including a breakdown for it.

It not only works on your address, but any address or unique identifier.
