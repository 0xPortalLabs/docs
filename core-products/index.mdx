## How It All Works Together

### 1. Points Discovery
Start by connecting your wallet to the Point Aggregator to discover all your points across supported projects. The system automatically detects points associated with your addresses and ENS domains.

### 2. Points Tokenization
Deposit your off-chain points to receive soulbound Point NFTs. The Oracle system verifies your points and creates immutable on-chain records of your deposits.

### 3. Trading and Exchange
Use your Point NFTs to create trading offers on the Point Exchange. Buy and sell points with collateral-backed security, ensuring safe transactions for all parties.

### 4. Portfolio Management
Track your points performance, set alerts, and analyze your portfolio using Point Tracking. Get insights into your earning patterns and optimize your strategy.

### 5. Settlement and Redemption
When projects launch their official tokens, use the settlement system to redeem your points tokens for real project tokens on multiple chains.
