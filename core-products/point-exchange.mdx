# Checkpoint Exchange

The **Points Exchange** is Checkpoint's core trading platform where users can buy and sell points before they become official tokens. All trades are secured with collateral to ensure both sellers and buyers fulfill their obligations on **settlement**.

<Note>Checkpoint Exchange is running at the moment on testnet</Note>

An important part of Checkpoint is that all trades are secured with collateral. This gives the points deposited trading value. The collateral is kept in an **escrow** contract until settlement. The collateral is typically a stablecoin like USDC, but can be any whitelisted token.

## Creating and Filling Offers
The market part of the exchange is a decentralized orderbook where users can either create or fill offers.

### Creating a Sell Offer
    Selling points requires users to have points to sell. For this, the user needs to have points on a platform that has been integrated to the Checkpoint Ecosystem and a market needs to be available for points to be traded.
    
    <Steps titleSize="h4">
      <Step title="Deposit Points">
        Users that want to sell points need to deposit their offchain points to be onchain. For this, the user needs to interact with the Deposit contract and verify that they have points to deposit.
      
        When a user deposits points, they receive a non-transferable NFT that represents the deposit onchain. This NFT becomes a record for users that they have onchain points to trade.
      
        A user needs to have enough available points to be able to make an offer.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Create a Sell Offer">
        After the user has deposited points, they can place a sell offer. A sell offer requires:
        * **Amount of points to sell**
        * **Price of the points sold**
        * **Collateral backing the sell offer**

        The collateral amount is separate from the price and acts as a security deposit. When creating an offer, users must provide collateral upfront. This collateral is held in escrow until settlement.

        **Offer Status**

        Offers have different statuses and behaviors depending on their state.

        * **Created**: Your offer is live and available for buyers to fill
        * **Filled**: Your offer has been completely filled by buyers
        * **Partially Filled**: Some buyers have filled part of your offer
        * **Settled**: The offer has been settled
        * **Cancelled**: You have cancelled the offer

        **Offer Management**

        Once you have created a sell offer, you can manage it through the UI.

        * You can only cancel offers that are in "Created" status
        * Partially filled offers cannot be cancelled, they must be settled
        * When you cancel an offer, you pay a cancellation fee
        
        When cancelling your collateral is returned minus protocol fees and your points become available again for new offers.
        <Warning>Balance change can trigger [Shortfall Event](/architecture/market-trading#shortfall-of-points), enabling buyers to cancel offers within a time frame</Warning>
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Seller Settlement">
        Settlement is the final phase where you receive payment for your sold points. Settlement occurs when a protocol's token launches and becomes available for distribution.
      
        **When Settlement begins**

        * Settlement is triggered when a protocol's token launches
        * No new offers can be created once settlement is active
        * Your existing offers must be settled according to their terms
               
        **Settlement Process for Sellers**

        * You must transfer the protocol tokens to the settlement contract
        * Your collateral is returned to you
        * You receive payment for the points you sold
        * A settlement fee is deducted from your payment

        <Danger>Overdue settlement result in additional fees and partial or total loss of the collateral</Danger>

    </Steps>

### Filling a Buy Offer
    Buying points on Checkpoint Exchange means filling existing sell offers created by other users. You can either fill an entire offer or partially fill it with any amount you choose.
    
    <Steps titleSize="h3">
      <Step title="Finding Offers">
        Browse the orderbook to find offers for the points you want to buy. In the UI some of the elements you will see are

        * How many points are available
        * Price per point or total in USDC
        * How much has already been filled (if any)

        <Info>You cannot fill your own offers, you can only buy from other users' offers</Info>
      
      </Step>
      <Step title="Choosing Fill Type">
        After choosing an offer, you will be able to fill partially or the entire offer. This is based on how much USDC you are committing to fill. A 50% fill will also warrant 50% of the escrow tokens associated to the offer selected.
        
        This system allows for flexible trading where you can buy exactly the amount of points you want, regardless of the offer size.

        <Warning>Checkpoint does not currently have a secondary market for escrow tokens (chXXX)</Warning>

      </Step>
      <Step title="What you receive">
        After filling an offer, the seller's NFT will mint escrow tokens (chXXX) proportional to the amount filled. These escrow tokens are a 1:1 on the points the seller has deposited. However, this is not a 1:1 on tokens to be received on settlement.
        
        **Escrow tokens are not TGE Tokens**

         The escrow tokens (chXXX) are not representative of the tokens issued on TGE by the protocol, but the proportion of the user's claim to their TGE tokens.

         <Danger>The escrow tokens (chXXX) are not representative to the tokens issued on TGE by the protocol, but the proportion of the user claim to their TGE tokens</Danger>

      </Step>
      <Step title="Buyer Settlement">
       Settlement is the final phase where you receive the actual protocol tokens for your purchased points. Settlement occurs when a protocol's token launches and becomes available for distribution.
       
        **Settlement Process for Buyers**

        * You can claim your protocol tokens using your escrow tokens
        * The system calculates your share based on your escrow token balance
        * You receive the actual protocol tokens (not more escrow tokens)
        * Your escrow tokens are burned in the process

        **Overdue Settlement**

        * If a seller fails to provide their protocol tokens during settlement, they enter the "overdue" stage
        * In this case, a buyer can claim partial or total collateral of the seller minus protocol fees
        
        **Cross-Chain Settlement**

        * Settlement can occur on different chains than where you bought the points
        * You'll receive your protocol tokens on the appropriate chain
        * You may need to claim tokens on a different chain than where you made the purchase
