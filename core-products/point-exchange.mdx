# Point Exchange

The Point Exchange is Checkpoint's core trading platform where users can buy and sell points before they become official tokens. All trades are secured with collateral to ensure both parties fulfill their obligations.

## How to use

### Buying Points

When you want to buy points from another user:

1. **Browse Available Offers**: View all active sell offers for the points you want
2. **Review Terms**: Check the price, amount, and collateral requirements
3. **Post Collateral**: Deposit USDC as collateral to secure your purchase
4. **Execute Trade**: Complete the transaction and receive the points
5. **Hold Until TGE**: Keep your points until the official token launch

### Selling Points

When you want to sell your points:

1. **Deposit Points**: First tokenize your off-chain points through the deposit process
2. **Create Offer**: Set your desired price and amount to sell
3. **Post Collateral**: Deposit USDC as collateral to secure your sale
4. **Wait for Buyer**: Your offer appears in the marketplace for others to fill
5. **Complete Trade**: When filled, receive payment and transfer points to buyer

### Collateral & Escrow

All trades require collateral from both parties:

- **Buyer Collateral**: Ensures the buyer has funds to complete the purchase
- **Seller Collateral**: Ensures the seller will deliver the points as promised
- **Automatic Release**: Collateral is released when trades complete successfully
- **Dispute Resolution**: If either party fails to fulfill, the other keeps the collateral

### Settlement

After the Token Generation Event (TGE):

1. **Token Launch**: The official project token becomes available
2. **Settlement Activation**: The settlement contract is activated by the project
3. **1:1 Redemption**: Exchange your points tokens for real project tokens
4. **Cross-Chain Support**: Receive tokens on multiple chains if supported
