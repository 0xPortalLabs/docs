# Checkpoint NFT

The **Points NFT** are soulbound (non-transferable) NFTs that serve as immutable receipts for your points deposits. They provide a permanent, onchain record of your points history and are essential for participating in the Checkpoint ecosystem.

## What are Soulbound NFTs?

Soulbound NFTs are a special type of NFT that cannot be transferred to other addresses. They are permanently bound to the wallet that created them, ensuring

## How Point NFTs Work

### Creation Process

When you deposit points into Checkpoint:

1. **Points Verification**: Oracle verifies your offchain points
2. **NFT Minting**: A unique soulbound NFT is minted to your address
3. **Metadata Recording**: Points amount, project, and timestamp are recorded
4. **Permanent Storage**: NFT becomes a permanent part of your wallet

### NFT Properties

Each Point NFT contains:

- **Points Amount**: The exact amount of points deposited
- **Project ID**: Which project the points belong to
- **Deposit Timestamp**: When the points were deposited
- **Unique Token ID**: A unique identifier for this specific deposit
- **Metadata URI**: Link to additional metadata and artwork

### Metadata Structure

```json
{
  "name": "Checkpoint Points - [Project Name]",
  "description": "Soulbound NFT representing [amount] points from [project]",
  "image": "https://api.checkpoint.exchange/nft/[tokenId].png",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Points Amount",
      "value": "1000"

}
```
