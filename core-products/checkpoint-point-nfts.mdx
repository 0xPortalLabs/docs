# Checkpoint NFT

The **Points NFT** are soulbound (non-transferable) NFTs that serve as immutable receipts for your points deposits. They provide a permanent, onchain record of your points history and are essential for participating in the Checkpoint ecosystem.

## What are Soulbound NFTs?

Soulbound NFTs are a special type of NFT that cannot be transferred to other addresses. They are permanently bound to the wallet that created them, ensuring

## How Point NFTs Work

### Creation Process

When you deposit points into Checkpoint:

1. **Points Verification**: Oracle verifies your offchain points
2. **NFT Minting**: A unique soulbound NFT is minted to your address
3. **Metadata Recording**: Points amount, project, and timestamp are recorded
4. **Permanent Storage**: NFT becomes a permanent part of your wallet

### NFT Properties

Each Point NFT contains:

- **Points Amount**: The exact amount of points deposited
- **Project ID**: Which project the points belong to
- **Deposit Timestamp**: When the points were deposited
- **Unique Token ID**: A unique identifier for this specific deposit
- **Metadata URI**: Link to additional metadata and artwork

### Metadata Structure

## Technical Details

### Smart Contract

Point NFTs are implemented as:

- **ERC-721 Compliant**: Standard NFT interface for maximum compatibility
- **Soulbound Extension**: Custom logic preventing transfers

### Storage and Retrieval

- **Onchain Data**: Core data stored directly onchain
- **Historical Preservation**: All historical data is permanently preserved
- **Queryable**: Data is queryable onchain via the NFT

## Getting Started

1. **Deposit Points**: Start by depositing points from a supported project
2. **Receive NFT**: Automatically receive your soulbound Point NFT
3. **View in Wallet**: See your NFT in any compatible wallet
4. **Use for Trading**: Use the NFT to create trading offers
5. **Track History**: Use NFTs to track your complete points history

<Note>
  **Important**: Point NFTs are soulbound and cannot be transferred. They serve as permanent records of your points deposits and are required for trading activities.
