# Checkpoint NFT

Checkpoint NFT are soulbound (non-transferable) NFTs that serve as immutable receipts for your points deposits. They provide a permanent, on-chain record of your points history and are essential for participating in the Checkpoint ecosystem.

## What are Soulbound NFTs?

Soulbound NFTs are a special type of NFT that cannot be transferred to other addresses. They are permanently bound to the wallet that created them, ensuring:

- **Authentic Ownership**: Proves you are the original depositor of the points
- **Immutable History**: Creates a permanent record of your points activity
- **Fraud Prevention**: Prevents transfer of points receipts to other users
- **Audit Trail**: Provides complete transparency of your points journey

## How Point NFTs Work

### Creation Process

When you deposit points into Checkpoint:

1. **Points Verification**: Oracle verifies your off-chain points
2. **NFT Minting**: A unique soulbound NFT is minted to your address
3. **Metadata Recording**: Points amount, project, and timestamp are recorded
4. **Permanent Storage**: NFT becomes a permanent part of your wallet

### NFT Properties

Each Point NFT contains:

- **Points Amount**: The exact amount of points deposited
- **Project ID**: Which project the points belong to
- **Deposit Timestamp**: When the points were deposited
- **Unique Token ID**: A unique identifier for this specific deposit
- **Metadata URI**: Link to additional metadata and artwork

## NFT Metadata and Artwork

### Visual Design

Each Point NFT features:

- **Project Branding**: Custom artwork representing the source project
- **Points Visualization**: Visual representation of the points amount
- **Dynamic Elements**: Artwork that may change based on points amount
- **Rarity Indicators**: Special visual elements for significant deposits

### Metadata Structure

```json
