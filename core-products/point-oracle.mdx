# Checkpoint Oracle

The **Points Oracle** is Checkpoint's verification layer. It fetches points data from offchain sources and signs it with cryptographic signatures, making the data verifiable onchain.

The Oracle is a core component of Checkpoint and is responsible for writing points data to the blockchain, verifying claims and settlement among other things.

## Oracle Functionalities

The Oracle serves two major functions: verifying off-chain point deposits before they go on-chain, and confirming settlement claims when protocols TGE. Fundamentally, these translate to various programmatic features:
