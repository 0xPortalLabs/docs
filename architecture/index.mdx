# Technical Overview

Checkpoint is a decentralized protocol that bridges offchain loyalty points with onchain liquidity. Users can tokenize their points, trade them before a Token Generation Event (TGE), and redeem them for real tokens after launch.

## Five Core Contracts

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Deposit Points

You sign your points claim offchain with the oracle, then submit a deposit transaction. You receive a [**Soulbound NFT**](/core-products/checkpoint-point-nfts) that proves ownership and tracks your history.

### Phase 2: Trade

Before TGE, you can trade your points with other users on the [Market contract](/architecture/market-trading). All trades are collateral-backed for safety.

### Phase 3: Settlement

Once the real token launches, you redeem your [escrow tokens](/architecture/points-tokenization#2-escrow-token-chxxx-tokens) for the actual token at a determined ratio.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Soulbound NFT** | Non-transferable receipt proving your point deposit and tracking history |
| **Escrow Tokens** | Your tradeable claim on future tokens (exists pre-TGE only) |
| **Oracle Verification** | Cryptographic validation that your offchain points exist |
| **Settlement** | Conversion of escrow tokens to real tokens post-TGE |

## Pre-TGE vs Post-TGE

| Aspect                 | Pre-TGE                            | Post-TGE                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Your Tokens**        | Escrow tokens (1:1 representation) | Actual project tokens       |
| **Can Trade?**         | Yes, via Market contract           | No, you own the real tokens |
| **Collateral Needed?** | Yes, trades require backing        | No, direct ownership        |
| **Where?**             | Checkpoint Market                  | Any DEX/exchange            |
| **Settlement**         | Coming soon                        | Completed                   |

## Crosschain Support

For projects launching on multiple chains, LayerZero integration enables:

- Escrow tokens on multiple chains before TGE
- Crosschain settlement after token launch
- Consistent 1:1 ratios across all chains
