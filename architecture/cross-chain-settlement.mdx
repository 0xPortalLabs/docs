# Cross-Chain Settlement

Settlement is the final step: converting your escrow tokens into real project tokens. For projects launching on multiple blockchains, Checkpoint uses LayerZero to coordinate distribution across chains seamlessly.

## What is Settlement?

Settlement is the process that happens after TGE (Token Generation Event) where:

1. **The project token launches** on one or more blockchains
2. **Checkpoint activates settlement** for that points program
3. **Escrow tokens convert** to real project tokens at 1:1 ratio
4. **Users can claim** their tokens on any supported chain

## The Timeline

  timeline title Points to Tokens Journey section Pre-TGE Month 1: Users deposit
  points Month 2: Users trade on Market Month 3: More users deposit and trade
  section TGE Day 1: Project launches token on Ethereum Day 2: Settlement
  activated section Post-TGE Week 1: Users settle and claim tokens Week 2:
  LayerZero bridges to other chains Week 3: Users redeem on Polygon, Arbitrum,
  etc.
</Mermaid>

## Single Chain Settlement

For projects launching on one blockchain:

<Mermaid>
  sequenceDiagram participant Maker as Offer Maker
  <br />
  (Seller) participant Buyer as Offer Filler
  <br />
  (Buyer) participant Settlement participant Token as Real Token Note over
  Maker,Token: TGE: Token launches Note over Maker,Token: Settlement activated
  Maker->>Settlement: I settle my offer Settlement->>Maker: You need to provide
  X tokens Maker->>Token: Approves X tokens to Settlement Maker->>Settlement:
  I'm depositing my tokens now Settlement->>Token: Take tokens from Maker
  Settlement->>Buyer: Buyer receives X tokens Note over Maker,Buyer: Offer
  settled! Buyer->>Buyer: Has real tokens now
</Mermaid>

### Step-by-Step

1. **Project announces TGE**

   - Token will launch on [specific date]
   - Will be available on [specific chains]

2. **Token is deployed**

   - Real token contract created
   - Liquidity pools launched
   - Checkpoint enables settlement

3. **Offer makers settle**

   - For each filled offer, the maker (seller) must provide tokens
   - Example: If they sold 100 points, they provide 100 tokens

4. **Buyers receive tokens**

   - Once maker settles, buyers get their tokens
   - Full 1:1 exchange (100 escrow tokens → 100 real tokens)

5. **Market price confirmed**
   - Users can now trade on DEXes
   - Real market price is established

## Multi-Chain Settlement

For projects on multiple chains, it's more complex:

<Mermaid>
  graph TB A["TGE Announced
  <br />
  Launch on Ethereum & Polygon"] B["Token deployed on Ethereum"] C["Settlement
  activated on Ethereum"] D["Users settle on Ethereum"] E["LayerZero bridges
  settlement"] F["Token wrapped on Polygon"] G["Users can claim on Polygon"] A
  --> B --> C --> D D --> E --> F --> G
</Mermaid>

### How It Works

1. **Primary chain settles**

   - Real token launches on main chain (e.g., Ethereum)
   - Settlement contract validates all offers
   - Makers provide tokens, buyers receive them

2. **Layer Zero bridges**

   - Settlement contract sends message to other chains
   - "Buyer ABC received 100 tokens on Ethereum, please create them on Polygon"

3. **Secondary chains confirm**

   - Other chains receive the message
   - Create wrapped or bridged versions of the token
   - Users can claim on their preferred chain

4. **Users redeem cross-chain**
   - Users with escrow tokens on Polygon can claim
   - Settlement proves they're entitled to tokens (was registered on Ethereum)
   - Users receive bridged tokens

## LayerZero Integration

LayerZero is a cross-chain messaging protocol that lets Checkpoint coordinate settlement across blockchains.

<Mermaid>
  graph LR A["Ethereum
  <br />
  Settlement Contract"] B["LayerZero
  <br />
  Message Bus"] C["Polygon
  <br />
  Settlement Contract"] D["Arbitrum
  <br />
  Settlement Contract"] A -->|Send message| B B -->|Deliver message| C B
  -->|Deliver message| D C -->|Acknowledgment| B D -->|Acknowledgment| B B
  -->|Confirm| A
</Mermaid>

### What LayerZero Does

- **Messaging**: Sends settlement confirmations between chains
- **Verification**: Confirms messages are authentic
- **Coordination**: Ensures same settlement rules on all chains
- **Trustless**: Uses blockchain validators, not centralized parties

### Example Cross-Chain Settlement

```
User A's offer: Sold 500 points for 50 USDC
- Created offer on Ethereum
- Filled on Ethereum
- User A (seller) has escrow tokens on Ethereum
- User B (buyer) has escrow tokens on Ethereum

TGE happens:
- Token launches on Ethereum AND Polygon

Settlement on Ethereum:
- User A provides 500 tokens on Ethereum
- User B receives 500 tokens on Ethereum

User B wants to claim on Polygon instead:
- LayerZero sends message: "User B claimed 500 on Ethereum"
- Polygon settlement receives message
- User B can now claim 500 bridged tokens on Polygon
```

## Pre-TGE vs Post-TGE Differences

| Stage                     | Your Tokens           | Trading             | Settlement             | Chain                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Pre-TGE**               | Escrow tokens         | Can trade on Market | N/A                    | Could be on Ethereum + other chains |
| **Post-TGE Single-Chain** | Real tokens           | Trade on DEX        | Immediate on one chain | Single chain                        |
| **Post-TGE Multi-Chain**  | Real tokens (bridged) | Trade on DEX        | Can claim on any chain | Any chain in network                |

## Settlement Workflows

### Workflow 1: Simple Seller

```
1. You created offer: Sell 100 points for 10 USDC
2. Someone filled it: You got 10 USDC already
3. TGE happened
4. You provide 100 real tokens to settle
5. You keep the 10 USDC + any collateral
6. Buyer gets 100 real tokens
Done!
```

### Workflow 2: Simple Buyer

```
1. You filled offer: Paid 10 USDC for 100 points
2. You have 100 escrow tokens now
3. TGE happened
4. Settlement activated
5. You redeem 100 escrow tokens
6. You get 100 real tokens
7. You can trade on DEX or hold
Done!
```

### Workflow 3: Cross-Chain Buyer

```
1. You filled offer: Have 100 escrow tokens on Ethereum
2. TGE happened on Ethereum + Polygon
3. Settlement activated
4. You could claim on Ethereum, but you prefer Polygon
5. LayerZero confirms your settlement from Ethereum
6. You claim 100 bridged tokens on Polygon
7. You can trade on Polygon DEX
Done!
```

### Workflow 4: Multi-Fill Seller

```
1. You created offer: 1,000 points at 100 USDC
2. Buyer A filled 400 points (40 USDC)
3. Buyer B filled 300 points (30 USDC)
4. Buyer C filled 300 points (30 USDC)
5. TGE happened
6. You provide 1,000 tokens to settle
7. Buyers A, B, C each get their respective tokens
8. You keep 100 USDC total + collateral
Done!
```

## Vesting Integration

Some projects release tokens gradually (vesting):

```
TGE: Tokens launch
You earned: 1,000 tokens
Vesting terms: 10% at TGE, 90% vested over 12 months

At TGE: You receive 100 tokens
After 3 months: You can claim additional 225 tokens
After 6 months: You can claim additional 450 tokens
After 12 months: You can claim remaining 900 tokens
```

Checkpoint handles this automatically. The Oracle can verify vesting schedules and help with claims.

## What Happens If Makers Don't Settle?

### Scenario: Maker Doesn't Provide Tokens

```
Offer: Seller promised 100 tokens for 10 USDC
Buyer: Filled offer, has 100 escrow tokens
Seller: Doesn't provide tokens at settlement

Result:
- Buyer's escrow tokens remain (can't be settled)
- Buyer keeps the 10 USDC they paid before (transaction happened)
- Seller keeps any collateral they posted
- The trade fails, but no one loses except the buyer gets USDC back
```

The collateral system minimizes this risk by making defaults expensive.

## Settlement Fees

Projects may charge fees for settlement:

```
You earned: 1,000 tokens
Settlement fee: 1% (configurable)

You receive: 990 tokens
Fees go to: Project treasury or community fund
```

These are configured by the project during setup.

## Key Concepts

### Settlement Deadline

- Projects set a deadline by which makers must settle
- If missed, automatic processes handle settlement
- Prevents indefinite delays

### 1:1 Conversion

- Your escrow tokens convert to real tokens at exact 1:1 ratio
- 100 escrow tokens = 100 real tokens
- No slippage or loss of value in the conversion

### Maker Obligation

- Original sellers (makers) must provide tokens
- This is baked into the offer terms
- Collateral system ensures compliance

### Bridged Tokens

- Tokens on secondary chains are "bridged" versions
- Use LayerZero's bridge (or similar)
- Represent the same value as native tokens on primary chain

## Safety Guarantees

✓ **Your tokens are safe**: Can't be taken or modified once settled

✓ **Fair pricing**: Market determined the price before settlement

✓ **Guaranteed 1:1**: Escrow → Real token is always 1:1

✓ **Auditable**: Complete settlement history on-chain

✓ **Cross-chain verified**: LayerZero ensures consistency

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Happy Path

```
You deposit 500 points
Trade 200 points in market (for 20 USDC)
Hold 300 points
TGE happens
You redeem 300 escrow tokens → get 300 real tokens
You trade the 200 escrow tokens you sold? No, the buyer has them.
Buyer holds 200 escrow tokens → gets 200 real tokens
Everyone happy!
```

### Scenario 2: Multi-Chain Preference

```
You filled offer on Ethereum for 100 tokens
TGE happens (Ethereum + Polygon + Arbitrum)
You have escrow tokens on Ethereum but prefer Arbitrum
Settlement happens on Ethereum
LayerZero bridges your settlement
You claim on Arbitrum
You have Arbitrum's bridged version of the token
```

### Scenario 3: Vesting

```
You earned 1,000 tokens with 12-month vesting
Vesting: 10% at TGE, 90% over 12 months
Month 0: Get 100 tokens immediately
Month 3: Can claim 325 tokens total
Month 6: Can claim 550 tokens total
Month 12: Can claim all 1,000 tokens
```

## Key Takeaways

- **Settlement** converts escrow tokens to real project tokens after TGE
- **1:1 ratio**: Your escrow tokens are worth exactly 1 real token each
- **LayerZero** coordinates multi-chain settlement seamlessly
- **Vesting** lets projects release tokens gradually
- **Trustless**: Everything verified on-chain, no intermediary
- **Makers settle**: Original sellers must provide tokens
- **Buyers claim**: Those who filled offers receive tokens
- **Cross-chain**: Users can claim on their preferred blockchain
