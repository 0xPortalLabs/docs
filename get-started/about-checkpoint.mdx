# Checkpoint Protocol

Checkpoint began as an internal tool built to track points positions accumulated through Pendle. When the tool was shared with industry peers, they immediately asked for their own version, a way to view and track their personal points. That early interest gave rise to the [Points Aggregator](/core-products/point-aggregator).

The first version drew inspiration from VFAT and DefiLlama, two pillars of DeFi and data transparency in the web3 ecosystem. As more users explored Checkpoint, the limitations of traditional incentivization models became increasingly clear.

In response, core contributors expanded the project’s scope, leading to what is now Checkpoint Exchange.

You can learn more about the core contributors on <Icon icon="x-twitter" /> [blaze <Icon icon="arrow-up-right"/>](https://x.com/0xblaze_) and [synth <Icon icon="arrow-up-right"/>](https://x.com/0xSynth).

## What is Checkpoint Exchange?
**Checkpoint Exchange** is the onchain layer that turns participation into tradable value. Users can view the points they have earned from contributing to protocols or projects and, when possible, trade those points through the exchange.

Checkpoint represents a simple but powerful idea

> **Merit should carry value**

You contribute, you earn, and that effort should hold tangible weight.

The points you earn reflect time, commitment, and belief in the protocols you support. They are easy to distribute, but historically difficult to recognize or monetize. Checkpoint seeks to change that.

You deserve the ability to unlock value from what you have helped build and grow. Checkpoint enables this by giving you a transparent way to trade your efforts and track points as they evolve.

At its core, Checkpoint is about making effort measurable, transferable, and meaningful.

## Problems Solved

### Current State of Points

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fragmented Systems">
    Points exist in isolated silos across protocols and platforms, with no shared infrastructure or visibility.
    <Callout icon="puzzle-piece" iconType="solid">No unified way to view, verify, or aggregate earned value across ecosystems.</Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="No Liquidity">
    Points have no inherent market or transferability before token generation event.
    <Callout icon="droplet-slash" iconType="solid">Users and investors have no path to early realization of value.</Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Uncertain Value">
    There’s no reliable mechanism to price contribution or forecast the worth.
    <Callout icon="handshake-slash" iconType="solid"> Points represent potential, not realized value. Leaving users with no clear sense of value to contribution.</Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Limited Access">
    Only a small subset of users benefit from early allocations or insider access.
    <Callout icon="lock" iconType="solid">Communities driving growth stay locked out of the reward cycle.</Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Designed to close the gap between contribution and value, Checkpoint brings transparency and liquidity to the points economy.

## Our Vision

#### The Future of Points

We envision a world where effort holds measurable value, where engagement fuels liquidity, and where innovation and interoperability define how value moves across ecosystems.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Universal Points Economy" icon="coins">
    **We believe that effort should lead to value**

    Meritable contributions, regardless of where they originate, should translate into measurable and transferable worth within a unified points economy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Liquidity for Engagement" icon="water">
    **We believe that value should have access to liquidity**

    Participants deserve the ability to exchange and realize what they have helped materialize, transforming effort into tradable, transparent capital.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Programmable Ecosystem" icon="network-wired">
    **We believe that innovation thrives in open systems**

    A composable, programmable infrastructure empowers builders and protocols to create new experiences on top of Checkpoint’s foundation.
