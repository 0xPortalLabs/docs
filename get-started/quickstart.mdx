Get familiar with the core elements of the Checkpoint Exchange. This guide walks you through the app
and explains what to keep in mind when interacting with the protocol.

## What is Checkpoint?

Checkpoint is a decentralized protocol that bridges offchain loyalty points and rewards programs
with onchain liquidity. It enables seamless tokenization, trading, and settlement of points before
a Token Generation Event (TGE), giving users a way to bring real utility to their offchain rewards.

Turning isolated points programs into a unified layer of value, where rewards can move freely, be
verified, and find real market liquidity.

## Getting Started

### Points Aggregator

To get started with Checkpoint, you only need to navigate to the app and have an EVM compatible
address. You do not have to connect your own wallet. Simply paste any address, ENS, or Clusters name
to see the points allocated to it.

Checkpoint automatically resolves the address and activates the Points Aggregator, giving you an
overview of rewards collected across supported protocols.

If you do not have an address yet, use any of these links to see it in action:

  (0x4cb75146e98562c9d79b31649c6c739e4dcb7cd5)

The Points Aggregator only requires an EVM compatible address, but Checkpoint is built on a
universal identifier model. The protocol is not limited to addresses and can work with any unique
identifier capable of holding points.

### Points Exchange

The Points Aggregator gives users an overview of collected points. The Exchange takes it a step
further by allowing those points to be traded.

To place an offer, users must own the wallet where the points are allocated to. Navigating markets
does not require a wallet connection, but interacting with buy or sell offers does.

The process differs slightly depending on the action being taken.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Buying Points" icon="shopping-cart">
    After connecting a wallet, select the offer you wish to fill. Choose the quantity you want to
    purchase and press **buy** to initiate the transaction.

    ### Buying Points
    When buying tokenized points, you are entering into a fill agreement with the seller. This agreement is secured by an escrow smart contract that manages settlement once the Token Generation Event (TGE) occurs.

     It is recommended to understand how buying and settlement work before interacting with the protocol.

    <Steps>

  <Step title="Navigate to market">
    Visit any supported market to view active offers. Offers with a higher collateralization rate are generally preferred.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select an offer">
    Select an offer you wish to fill, this will prompt the trade panel to interact with it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decide on the fill">
    In the trade panel, adjust how much of the offer you want to fill.
    <Note>Committed funds will remain in the escrow smart contract until settlement or other parameters have been triggered.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Buy points">
    When ready, press **buy** to initiate the fill.
  </Step>
    <Step title="Receive tokenized points">
    Shortly after, your chXXX points will arrive. These tokens follow the LayerZero Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard, allowing you to bridge them across supported chains.
    <Warning>Checkpoint does currently not have a secondary market for chXXX</Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>
    ### Settlement for Buyers
    The funds you used to fill the order are held in an escrow smart contract. They are released to the seller only after the seller initiates a settlement. Once settlement begins, the seller transfers the tokens directly to the buyer on the chain where the TGE has occurred.

    Settlement is not a 1:1 conversion between points and chXXX tokens. Protocols may distribute more, fewer, or equal tokens compared to the issued chXXX tokens. Final settlement is calculated pro-rata to the points a user has received from the specific protocol market.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Selling Points" icon="store">
    ### Selling Points
    Before selling any points, you must first deposit your accumulated points. This process mints a soulbound NFT to your wallet address, which enables you to sell deposited points on the Checkpoint Exchange.

When creating a sell offer, you will need to define several parameters, including collateral to back the points you wish to sell. Once created, your offer escrows the collateral until settlement or other conditions are met. It is important to understand how the protocol operates before engaging with it.

    <Steps>

  <Step title="Navigate to market">
    Go to any supported market where you hold eligible points.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deposit points">
    If you have not yet deposited points, or your balance has increased, visit the Deposit Points section to deposit your updated amount.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Input sell parameters">
    Return to the trading panel and open the Sell tab. Enter your sell parameters, including price, quantity, and required collateral to back your offer.
    <Note>Committed collateral remains locked in the escrow smart contract until settlement or other parameters have been triggered.</Note>
  </Step>
    <Step title="Sell points">
    When ready, place your sell offer. This action locks the associated collateral and makes your offer available for buyers to fill.
  </Step>
</Steps>
    ### Settlement for Sellers
    When you initiate a sell offer, the collateral you provided is held in an escrow smart contract. Once a buyer fills your offer, their funds are also held in escrow until settlement.

After settlement, your collateral and the buyer’s payment are released to you, minus protocol fees.
You can cancel an open offer (subject to a cancellation fee) if it has not been filled. Offers that
have been partially filled cannot be cancelled.

Buyers may reverse an escrow if the oracle detects irregularities in point allocations. Failure to
settle or late settlement may result in the loss of your collateral.

## Listing on Checkpoint

Checkpoint has a few key requirements for listing a protocol or project on the Points Aggregator.
Being listed on the aggregator is a prerequisite but not a guarantee for becoming a tradable market.

If you want to see your favorite points system onboarded, here are the main things to keep in mind:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open points API">
    Protocols listed on Checkpoint must provide an open and accessible points API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stable points API">
    Stability is essential for the protocol to function properly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Active Community">
    While not mandatory, having an engaged community increases the value of integration and ensures
    the data is meaningful to users.
  </Step>
  <Step title="DefiLlama Integration">
    Also not required, but helpful for mapping total value locked (TVL) and related analytics.
  </Step>
</Steps>

To list your project on Checkpoint, reach out to the team or join the community to begin the
process. Power users may put a PR for integration.
